        <h1>Kashmir, India</h1>
        <p>One of the main tourist places in India is Kashmir which lies in the northernmost region of the country and is blessed with surreal natural beauty and myriad adventures. Kashmir offers two different experiences, one during the summers when the whole valley looks enthralling with its lush-green landscape and snow-capped mountains in the backdrop and other during the winter season when it is all covered with white snow. No matter when you plan a visit to this place, it will always offer you a blissful experience. It is known as the heaven on the Earth for a reason as it is a postcard-card perfect scenery drawn by nature.</p>
